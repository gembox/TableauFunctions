# TableauFunctions

This is a collection of functions that are meant to take tasks that can be time consuming in Tableau and turn them into python functions that can be easy to run. As I come up with new use cases, I will expand on the functions.

They are meant to be run against .twb files that are XML undeneath. If you have a .twbx file you can still use them, just unzip the .twbx first and run it agasint the .twb in the package.
